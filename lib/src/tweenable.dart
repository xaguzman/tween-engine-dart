/**
 * The [Tweenable] interface enables the object to be passed as target to the Tween Engine.
 * When you tween an object, you also provide a [tweenType], which will be passed to these methods.
 * The [tweenType] is our way of telling the engine which properties it should tween.
 * It's a very simple reflection implementation, if you want.
 *
 * Dart, unlike javascript and to provide better minification,
 * has no string accessors such as `myObject['myProperty']`.
 * You can only access a property using `myObject.myProperty`.
 * This will change when `dart:mirrors` are fully operational.
 * Though, as reflection incurs terrible overhead, especially when compiled to javascript,
 * it makes sense to implement these methods when speed is of the essence. (which it often is)
 *
 * This is a less verbose alternative to TweenAccessor for when you have control over the class
 * whose properties you want to interpolate.
